A repository for Christopher Loura's implementation of Huet's Algorithm in Zig.

The algorithm is based off of Daniel Gratzer's Haskell unification implementation found at https://github.com/jozefg/higher-order-unification

## Running the Program
1. Download Zig for your pc at https://ziglang.org/download/
2. Follow the Zig installation instructions: https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#installing-zig
3. Once zig is properly downloaded, clone the repository
4. Open a terminal at the repository location and run the following command: zig run test.zig
5. Follow the instructions from the program prompts

The ReadMe will be updated as time progresses with more information and additional fixes to the code
